# Segmentation-and-classification-of-trees-based-on-smartphone-images

This code including all the other files were part of my bachelor-thesis written in German.
I am currently a student at TU Wien.
My supervisors were Dipl.-Ing. Dr.techn Markus Hollaus and Dipl.-Ing. Benjamin Wild.

IMPORTANT:
The pictures are already resized (that's why the code for resized is grayed out.
To run this code you additionally need to download the "vit-h" model here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything?tab=readme-ov-file#model-checkpoints
